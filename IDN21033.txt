for DAMAGING WINDS, LARGE HAILSTONES and HEAVY RAINFALL

For people in Hunter, Southern Tablelands, North West Slopes and Plains, South West Slopes, Australian Capital Territory and parts of Mid North Coast, Illawarra, South Coast, Central Tablelands, Central West Slopes and Plains, Riverina, Lower Western, Upper Western, Snowy Mountains and Northern Tablelands Forecast Districts.

Issued at 3:28 pm Tuesday, 19 December 2023.

Severe thunderstorms continue to develop.

Weather Situation:
A trough extending from northwest New South Wales through central parts of the state is generating severe thunderstorms in a hot and humid environment ahead of a strengthening upper trough.

Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding in the warning area over the next several hours. Locations which may be affected include Taree, Newcastle, Batemans Bay, Canberra, Goulburn, Tamworth, Moree, Tibooburra and Cobar.

The State Emergency Service advises that people should:
    * Move your car under cover or away from trees. 
    * Secure or put away loose items around your house, yard and balcony. 
    * Keep at least 8 metres away from fallen power lines or objects that may be energised, such as fences. 
    * Report fallen power lines to either Ausgrid (131 388), Endeavour Energy (131 003), Essential Energy (132 080) or Evoenergy (131 093) as shown on your power bill. 
    * Trees that have been damaged by fire are likely to be more unstable and more likely to fall. 
    * Keep clear of creeks and storm drains. 
    * Don't walk, ride your bike or drive through flood water. 
    * If you are trapped by flash flooding, seek refuge in the highest available place and ring 000 if you need rescue. 
    * Be aware that run-off from rainfall in fire affected areas may behave differently and be more rapid. It may also contain debris such as ash, soil, trees and rocks. 
    * After bushfires, heavy rain and the loss of foliage can make the ground soft and heavy, leading to a greater chance of landslides. 
    * Unplug computers and appliances. 
    * Avoid using the phone during the storm. 
    * Stay indoors away from windows, and keep children and pets indoors as well. 
    * Stay vigilant and monitor conditions. Note that the landscape may have changed following bushfires. 
    * For emergency help in floods and storms, ring the SES (NSW and ACT) on 132 500. 
 

The next warning is due to be issued by 6:30 pm.

If severe thunderstorms develop in Sydney Newcastle Wollongong or surrounding areas or Canberra and Queanbeyan, a more detailed Severe Thunderstorm Warning will be issued to people in these areas.
