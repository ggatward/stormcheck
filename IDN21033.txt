The State Emergency Service advises that people should: 
    * Move your car under cover or away from trees. 
    * Secure or put away loose items around your house, yard and balcony. 
    * Keep at least 8 metres away from fallen power lines or objects that may be energised, such as fences. 
    * Report fallen power lines to either Ausgrid (131 388), Endeavour Energy (131 003), Essential Energy (132 080) or Evoenergy (131 093) as shown on your power bill. 
    * Trees that have been damaged by fire are likely to be more unstable and more likely to fall. 
    * Keep clear of creeks and storm drains. 
    * Don't walk, ride your bike or drive through flood water. 
    * If you are trapped by flash flooding, seek refuge in the highest available place and ring 000 if you need rescue. 
    * Be aware that run-off from rainfall in fire affected areas may behave differently and be more rapid. It may also contain debris such as ash, soil, trees and rocks. 
    * After bushfires, heavy rain and the loss of foliage can make the ground soft and heavy, leading to a greater chance of landslides. 
    * Unplug computers and appliances. 
    * Avoid using the phone during the storm. 
    * Stay indoors away from windows, and keep children and pets indoors as well. 
    * Stay vigilant and monitor conditions. Note that the landscape may have changed following bushfires. 
    * For emergency help in floods and storms, ring the SES (NSW and ACT) on 132 500.
